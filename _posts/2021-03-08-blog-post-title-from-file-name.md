## Strainer supplier in Dubai
UAE Valves is famous for Strainer Supplier in Dubai, UAE. Strainer are important components that help maintain the integrity and efficiency of pipeline systems by removing unwanted debris, dirt and particles from medium (gas, liquid or steam). These elements, if not uncontrolled, can cause widespread damage to the pipeline system and interfere with the steady function of the machinery.

How Strainers Work 

Strainer is designed to remove particulate matter from liquids in pipelines. The liquid is fed into the Strainer valve through an inlet port and passes through the Strainer element. Mesh or perforated element acts as a filter; It catches dirt and suspended particles so that the clean fluid can flow further into the system. 
The fluid comes out of the valve outlet when passing through a screen element. Therefore, it ensures that the pipeline system only carries a clean fluid without contamination that can cause obstacle, damage or deficiency in the general efficiency of the system. After a long time, the debris on the Strainer element is collected and requires cleaning or flushing to ensure that the system goes well.
Some strainers have flush openings to help dislodge the collected particles. Others, the strainer element must be taken out for cleaning. Other designs have drain plugs that ensure easy removal of trapped particles, making cleaning faster. 

Advantages of Strainers 

1. Pipeline Clogging Prevention: Strainers function as filters in preventing debris from entering the pipeline, keeping the system free flowing and functional. 

2. Prevents damaging useful equipment: Filters prevent corrosive and scaling particulates from attacking critical pumps, valves, compressors, and similar machinery in systems. 

3. Sustain efficiency: In the fluid flow Strainers help achieve stable fluid flows. In effect, pressure losses that might cut or drop fluids off could have their adverse effect on the rest of the system efficiency. 

4. Maintaining contaminants: By entering important water systems helps companies to follow environmental laws by maintaining the safety and adherence of environmental rules, and protecting stress -sensitive areas. 

5. Long -lasting cost savings: Stress helps to ensure continuous operation and long -term cost savings by reducing shutdowns and reducing expensive equipment damage. 

6. Corrosion protection: Stress protects pipelines and machines from corrosion, which can cause wear and tears with long terms by preventing corrosive particles from exposure to fluid.

Industrial Sectors That Use Strainers 

- Water Treatment: Before water is prepared for human consumption or other uses, strainers are employed in water treatment facilities to make sure that dangerous contaminants are removed. 

- Chemical Industry: In chemical processing, strainers allow free movement in the equipment and pipes to keep the production cycle going, which lowers the likelihood that the products will become contaminated. 

- Petrochemical Industry: In this industry, petrochemical firms use strainers to safeguard critical equipment and pipelines from destructive materials that could eventually clog those harmful particles away from the costly equipment. 

1. Simplex Basket Strainer: Simple in construction, simplex basket strainers are used in applications involving small flow rates. Their installation and maintenance are relatively straightforward and easy and thus best used for simple applications. 

2. Duplex Basket Strainer: Duplex basket strainers are best applied to large flow applications where continuity of operation is desired. Since maintenance can be performed without interrupting the pipeline, flow remains unaffected. 

3. Y Strainer : The Y strainer is identifiable by its letter 'Y'. It is mounted in horizontal pipeline lines. Its design is very simple, cost-effective and highly efficient in gathering debris from the flow. 

Parts of a Strainer 

1. Body: The body is the main structure that gives a mounting point between the strainer and pipeline, which also contains all the inner parts. It is usually made from strong material to withstand high-pressure operations. 

2. Strainer Element: This is the mesh or perforated part inside the strainer that physically filters out unwanted particles from the fluid. The size of the mesh is carefully chosen based on the type of fluid and the size of the debris to be filtered. 

3. Inlet and Outlet Ports: These are the inlet and outlet where the fluid is introduced and then exits the strainer. The ports should be designed to pass the volume and pressure of the fluid. 

4. Cap or Cover: This cover or cap keeps the strainer element in position while facilitating simple access for cleaning or maintenance. 

5. Drain plug: A drain stop is positioned at the strainer's bottom, making it possible to easily remove any accumulated dirt or debris there. This would be really useful for cleaning purposes and can also be employed for maintenance as well.
